# Hot Beverage

It's a twitter bot that gets famous quotes and puts coffee emojis in them. I'm not really sure what the joke is, honestly, I just hadn't made a bot in a while and this was an achievable idea I had.

It scrapes a famous quotes web page to get some quotes, runs them by a text processing thing to tag them with parts of speech, and then replaces a random noun with the coffee emoji.

It's currently living at [@intothebean](http://twitter.com/intothebean).
